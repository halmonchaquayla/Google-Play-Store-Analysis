TERRARIA MOBILE REBUILT FROM THE GROUND UP – NEW AND IMPROVED AND NOW INCLUDING ALL OF THE CONTENT FROM THE EPIC JOURNEY’S END 1.4 UPDATE!


""This is the full version of Terraria, built from the ground up... If you loved it on PC or consoles, you’ll love it here.” - Slide To Play


The very world is at your fingertips as you fight for survival, fortune, and glory. Delve deep into cavernous expanses, seek out ever-greater foes to test your mettle in combat, or construct your own city - In the World of Terraria, the choice is yours!


We recommend at least 2GB of RAM and a device from 2014 or newer. We support devices running Android 4.3 with 1GB of RAM and compatible graphics, but these devices may experience reduced performance.

• MULTIPLAYER – Play with up to 7 friends on Local Wifi or Online via device-device Wifi hosted games or through the Mobile Terraria Dedicated Server for PC (available for free on Terraria.org)
• TERRARIA REIMAGINED FOR MOBILE – Fully customizable controls and User Interface provide a level of polish and capability not previously possible!
• Gamepad support – including fully-remappable buttons - Play with your Bluetooth connected gamepad where supported.
• Full array of World sizes – Small/Medium/Large...the same size as on Terraria for PC!  Now includes random world name generator and the ability to use World Seeds (including some hidden easter egg worlds)
• Over 400 enemies to combat, defeat, and plunder for loot
• Over 20 Biomes and Mini-Biomes to explore, both above and underground – from lush forests to barren deserts to dungeons, the underworld, and even the terrifying Corruption await!
• Updated crafting with multiple added item options
• Over 20 NPCs to discover, each providing their own benefits and unique style
• In-depth building options that are easy to learn but allow for amazing feats of architecture in the hands of a master.
• And much, much more!

In short, every pixel of Terraria has been reimagined and hand crafted for the BEST possible mobile experience!

Five Nights at Freddy's,"NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.

Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

""For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games."" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com

NOTE: Game entirely in English.

Welcome to the ultimate FNaF mashup, where you will once again be trapped alone in an office fending off killer animatronics! Featuring 50 selectable animatronic characters spanning seven Five Nights at Freddy's games, the options for customization are nearly endless. Mix and match any assortment of characters that you like, set their difficulty from 0-20, then jump right into the action! From your office desk, you will need to manage two side doors, two vents, as well as two air hoses, all of which lead directly into your office.

This time you will have to master other tools as well if you want to complete the ultimate challenges, tools such as the heater, A/C, a global music box, a power generator, and more. As if all of that weren't enough, you'll also need to set up laser traps in the vents, collect Faz-Coins, purchase items from the Prize Counter, and as always, keep a close eye on not one, but two, Pirate Cove curtains!

Other features also included:
- Challenge menu including sixteen themed challenges
- Voice acting from returning favorites as well as from new arrivals to the franchise
- Unlockable office skins
- Unlockable cutscenes

Five Nights at Freddy's 2,"NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.

Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!

What could go wrong?

As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.

NOTE: Game entirely in English.

In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.

FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,"NOTE: A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.

Prospective owner of a Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria franchised restaurant, we want you!

What starts out as a simple pizza tossing fun turns into something much, much more. Push through the glitchy arcade game to reveal that you are at your own Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria!

Browse our catalogs and purchase your first attractions and animatronics, customize your decorations, and above all make sure that all the equipment is working properly before opening the doors of your brand new Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria!

After a busy day, wrap up the paperwork and shut down your business (often late into the night as you build your own business!) Be careful, however, of what could possibly lurk in the air vents. If anything should catch your attention, turn your flashlight straight into the vent to repel it, Fazbear Entertainment supplies batteries free of charge to all of its franchisees!

The next day, assuming you have survived during the night, reinvest your income from yesterday in new equipment. Develop your little pizzeria, day after day, to see it become an empire of catering and entertainment! Fazbear Entertainment provides its franchisees with all the tools and knowledge necessary to create and manage a welcoming, secure and profitable location.

Oh and if you feel up to it, try to salvage some of the animatronics that wander outside your restaurant. They are trying to get in for months now, better not miss on the opportunity to pick up spare parts and rake in some additional revenue. If you detect any instability or aggressiveness in any of them, use the self-defense taser that Fazbear Entertainment provides free of charge to all of its franchisees.

This puts an end to the assistance that we are legally obligated to provide. Fazbear Entertainment cannot be held responsible for the disappearances, deaths or mutilations that may occur as a result of operating the Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria franchise.

Don't wait any longer and start today!

Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,"We want to thank you for being valued fans and let you know that as of July 25, 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies will no longer be available to play in EU Countries.

***Now compatible Android M (6.0) ***

The Call of Duty: Zombies phenomenon has risen back to life.

Adapted from the best-selling console hit and built specifically for tablets and smartphones, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies delivers fan-favorite, heart-pounding maps: Kino Der Toten, Ascension, and Call of the Dead: Director’s Cut, as well as “Dead-Ops Arcade,” a 50-level zombie gauntlet that provides the ultimate undead challenge for fans of Call of Duty’s signature zombie warfare.

Play solo or join a team of up to 4 players via Wi-Fi as you mow down hordes of zombies using a variety of weapons and perks only available in the Call of Duty zombie experience. 

And don’t just take our word for it; here is what critics think of the game:

•	“Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies is a must-have for any Call of Duty fan and for everyday gamers alike.” – Mashable.com

•	""As far as the whole package is concerned, I adore the Dead Ops Arcade mode and feel it adds significant value to the $6.99 price tag"" – Destructoid

•	“Dead Ops…a perfect fit for the mobile platform.” – G4 TV online

Players can also opt to enhance their experience and get out of a jam with the in-game CoD Point System. With six tiers of in-app purchasing options to choose from, Zombies fans will be able to take their experience to a whole new level by unlocking additional areas and securing better weapons in much less time.  Please note that CoD points are only applicable in single player.

•	Buy CoD points in the Main Menu to use when you run out of earned points in-game.
•	CoD points can be spent on anything in the game such as reviving, opening doors, weapons, perks, and the mystery box but are only used when you do not have enough earned points.
•	Revives can also be bought with CoD points if you die without the revive perk, although the three revive limit still applies.
•	Note: Your CoD points will be lost if the app is uninstalled from your device.

Sure, earning Achievements and Point-Multipliers is nice, but to survive these Co-Op Maps, you’ll need friends as much as you’ll need firepower. Lucky for you, not only will the weapons and perks you love from Call of Duty lie at your fingertips, you can join with up to 4 players via Wi-Fi to play mulitiplayer. 
 
As if that wasn’t enough, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies also includes “Dead-Ops Arcade” mode, an arcade-style top-down shooter perfectly suited for mobile combat vets. Unlocking the mode is easy—simply find the four missing coins in the game’s menus.","We want to thank you for being valued fans and let you know that as of July 25, 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies will no longer be available to play in EU Countries.<br><br>***Now compatible Android M (6.0) ***<br><br>The Call of Duty: Zombies phenomenon has risen back to life.<br><br>Adapted from the best-selling console hit and built specifically for tablets and smartphones, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies delivers fan-favorite, heart-pounding maps: Kino Der Toten, Ascension, and Call of the Dead: Director’s Cut, as well as “Dead-Ops Arcade,” a 50-level zombie gauntlet that provides the ultimate undead challenge for fans of Call of Duty’s signature zombie warfare.<br><br>Play solo or join a team of up to 4 players via Wi-Fi as you mow down hordes of zombies using a variety of weapons and perks only available in the Call of Duty zombie experience. <br><br>And don’t just take our word for it; here is what critics think of the game:<br><br>•	“Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies is a must-have for any Call of Duty fan and for everyday gamers alike.” – Mashable.com<br><br>•	&quot;As far as the whole package is concerned, I adore the Dead Ops Arcade mode and feel it adds significant value to the $6.99 price tag&quot; – Destructoid<br><br>•	“Dead Ops…a perfect fit for the mobile platform.” – G4 TV online<br><br>Players can also opt to enhance their experience and get out of a jam with the in-game CoD Point System.

<b>Death is not the end.</b>

Play as a failed alchemic experiment and explore the sprawling, ever-changing castle to find out what happened on this gloomy island…! That is, assuming you’re able to fight your way past its keepers.

<i>Dead Cells</i> is a <b>roguevania action platformer from Motion Twin</b> that will require you to master <b>frantic 2D combat with a wide variety of weapons and skills</b> against merciless minions and boss.

<b>• Roguevania:</b> The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath

<b>• Frantic and Dynamic 2D Action:</b> Learn your enemies’ patterns to stay alive, or prepare to be sent back to your cell before you can say “baguette”

<b>• Nonlinear Progression:</b> Unlock new levels with every death, opt for the path that suits your current build, your playstyle or just your mood. Surely, the ramparts can’t be as bad the sewers, right?

<b>• Play at your own pace:</b> Will you explore every nook and cranny of the castle, or rush to the end?

<b>Take a break from the frenzy of the castle and have a stroll through some luxurious scenery with The Bad Seed DLC.</b>

Exploding Kittens® - Official,"Exploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for Android!

Creat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).

KEY FEATURES:

- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.

- Play with 2 to 5 friends or strangers online

- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal

- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens

- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.

A Dance of Fire and Ice,"A Dance of Fire and Ice is a simple one-button rhythm game. Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.

It's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure you would enjoy this game!

Features:

- 20 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world has its own unique hand-drawn fantasy landscape, and has short tutorial levels followed by a full-length boss level.

- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and blisteringly fast bonus levels for the brave.

- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.

- Calibration options: Auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so please use your ears more than your eyes when playing.

WARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part you just need to keep a consistent beat - but keeping a beat is not very easy. So don't worry if you find it difficult!","A Dance of Fire and Ice is a simple one-button rhythm game.

Papa's Mocharia To Go!,"Create delicious coffee drinks and cannoli in Papa's Mocharia To Go!

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

Papa Louie has opened a brand-new coffee shop in New Pepperton, offering a variety of custom layered coffee drinks called Papaccinos.  After you apply for a job as the barista of Papa's Mocharia, you learn that a year-long film is being made about the coffeehouse -- and you're now the main star!  Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.

-- GAME FEATURES --

BREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.  On the Build Station, you'll layer the espresso and milk into a large cup along with colorful powders and flavored syrups, creating a delicious layered latte that looks as great as it tastes!  Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.
 
CRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.  Choose the cannoli shell, line up the nozzles to pipe it full of cream, and garnish the cannoli with delicious toppings for the perfect sweet treat to enjoy with a coffee.

HOLIDAY FLAVORS - Celebrate the seasons with delicious holiday flavors!  As you reach new ranks, the seasons and holidays in New Pepperton will change, and your customers will start ordering holiday-themed drinks and cannoli.  You'll unlock new syrups, powders, dairy, shakers, creams, and cannoli shells for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying these new festive flavors!

SERVE SPECIAL RECIPES - Earn Special Recipes from your customers, and serve them as the Daily Special in the Mocharia!  Each Special has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  Master each special to earn a special prize!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS - Play as Allan or Akari, or create your own custom character to work in the coffeehouse!  You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - Some customers don't want to travel all the way to New Pepperton for their coffee.  When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their order, and you'll hire a Driver to help take and deliver orders to their homes instead!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection.  Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

DECORATE THE SHOP - Customize the Mocharia lobby with themed furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Mix and match your favorite styles, or add items that match the current holiday so customers won't mind waiting longer for their order.

60 Seconds! Atomic Adventure,"As Ted, a responsible citizen and a family man, you are faced with a slight disturbance to your happy, suburban lifestyle. THE NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.

With only 60 seconds left to impact, guide Ted in a mad, intense and action packed dash through his house in search of his family and useful supplies. Everything will be against you - time, your very own furniture, the house that's different every time you play and the fundamental question - what to take with you and who to leave behind?

Reaching the fallout shelter in time and alive is only the beginning. Whatever you scavenged and whoever you saved will play a vital role in your survival. Each survival story will be different, with every day surprising you with unexpected events. Will all of these stories end well? It's up to you. Ration food and water, make best use of your supplies, face difficult choices and even venture into the wasteland.

Good luck.

EXPERIENCE
the suburbian nightmare of a nuke dropping down on your neighbourhood in this atomic, dark comedy set in 1950s.

SCAVENGE
any supplies, you will need to survive, and family members in a 60 second rush through your procedurally generated house.

PREPARE
for the worst. Don’t just grab arbitrary items, plan your survival and follow helpful tips from emergency broadcasts!

SURVIVE
in a fallout shelter with whatever you brought with you. How many days will you last? Will everyone make it out alive?

DECIDE
what to do, when the post-apocalyptic world pushes you to the corner. Will you risk going outside? Who is not eating dinner, when barely any food is left? How do you deal with a mutant cockroach infestation?

Papa's Freezeria To Go!,"Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for Android phones!

You've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!

You'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**

Papa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

BUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens, so you can quickly and easily pour ice cream and mixables like a master!  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.

MIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!

TOP STATION - We've brought back the Topping Bin carousel from ""Papa's Burgeria To Go!"", which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!

Goat Simulator,"Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true!

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

<b>KEY FEATURES</b>
• You can be a goat 
• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it 
• In-game physics that bug out all the time 
• Seriously look at that goat's neck 
• You can be a goat

Marle, fearless and brimming with curiosity, volunteers to assist in a demonstration. An unanticipated malfunction, however, sends her hurtling through a rift in the dimensions. Taking hold of the girl's pendant, Crono bravely follows in pursuit. But the world into which he emerges is the one of four centuries before.

Bad North: Jotunn Edition,"Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defences. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.
 
Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.

It’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.

Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.

Key Features

REAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE: Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! 

INTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defences and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.

PROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.

UNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defence leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors.","Your home is under attack.

• WHAT’S THE STORY BEHIND THE HOUSE OF DA VINCI? •
You are Da Vinci’s most promising apprentice. Your master, Leonardo, has disappeared. You have no idea where he’s gone or what has happened. So you begin your quest, your search for the truth. However, Leonardo's workshop is full of puzzles, inventions, escape mechanisms and objects hidden in all corners of beautifully decorated rooms. You’ll need to use all of your brain cells to find out what’s really going on!

We’ve applied our own imagination to the story of the world’s greatest inventor, Leonardo da Vinci, providing players with unique special abilities throughout gameplay. We allow you to warp back into your early days as a young apprentice, exploring the 16th century world around you, peeking into Leonardo’s mechanisms, puzzles and devices, as you eventually become powerful enough to control time itself and learn the secrets hidden in the past.

Many challenging puzzles are inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's real inventions and ideas. Mysterious locations were created based on original artworks and the wonderful Florence, Italy of 1506.

Note:
- As this application is very large, it will take some time to download.
- This application takes up around 2GB of memory. Over 4GB of free space is required to download it, so make sure that ample spare memory is available before attempting to do so.

[Read before playing]

See the help page for how to trigger the special match while using the ""MAX Stats"" option.

Depending on the terrain and timing of the action, the buggy, submarines, airships, and other modes of transportation may cease to move when the player embarks or disembarks. Currently, the only fix is to restart the game from a data file saved before the bug occurred. We recommend saving frequently and/or utilizing multiple save files. This bug occurs most often when players embark or disembark while extremely close to the terrain, as well as during time-sensitive activities for events.

Please note that the game will not save automatically when escaping from a battle on the world map, even if the Auto Save function is set to the ON setting.

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

Your tour of Papa Louie's new restaurant goes awry when you break the lucky cat statue outside of the shop.  Is this to blame for the restaurant's underwhelming opening day?  When Papa Louie leaves on a mission to find a new statue, you're left in charge of Papa's Sushiria, where you need to master the fine art of sushi making!

You'll need to cook, season, and spread the rice onto nori and soy paper using the all-in-one ""Sushi Square"" cooker.  Add fillings to the sushi, and roll it up before placing toppings and drizzling sauces across the top.  Slice up the sushi into bite-sized pieces, and prepare a delicious Bubble Tea to serve alongside the order before serving it to your hungry customers.  Sakura Bay celebrates different holidays throughout the year, and you'll unlock new seasonal ingredients as you go for creating deliciously festive sushi and tea.

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,"<i>A game I made
For a certain kind of person

To hurt them.</i>

<b>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</b> is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.

To quote Jazzuo himself: <i>""The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well"".</i>

• Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot.
• Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand.
• Between 2 and ∞ hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to ∞.
• Lose all your progress, over and over.
• Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.","<i>A game I made<br>For a certain kind of person<br><br>To hurt them.</i><br><br><b>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</b> is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo&#39;s 2002 B-Game classic &#39;Sexy Hiking&#39;.

Toca Mystery House,"There’s a strange house on a strange street in a strange part of town. Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.

There are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe

Some kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!

I had to see for myself

I did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home.

But I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?

Farming USA 2,"Plow, fertilize, plant and harvest your own crops on 9 different fields across 250 acres. Grow and sell corn, wheat, barley, soybeans and hay. Play cross-platform multiplayer with your friends, lending them a hand on their farm.

Feel the landscape as you roam in your tractor with realistic wheel physics!

Raise livestock in four unique ways! 

- Cattle can be raised by pasture (where you can breed your own cows with bulls) or feedlot (for faster growth).

Use the market to control cash-flow as you see real time fluctuations. 

Watch the weather as rain and sun affects the growth and harvest of crops! Too much rain and your fields become muddy. A hard snow in winter will require you to hook up the snow plows to get out of the lot.

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

You just got a new job at Papa's Donuteria in the whimsical town of Powder Point!  The pay and benefits are nice, but you took the job for that coveted Line-Jump Pass for the amusement park right outside the shop.  It's not all fun and games though: Now you also have to cook delicious donuts every day for all of the crazy customers in this carnival-like town.

You'll need to prepare donuts using a variety of doughs and shapes, then toss them in the fryer and cook both sides until they're just right.  Finish the delicious donuts with tasty fillings, icing, and toppings before serving them to your hungry customers.  First-time visitors may just order one donut to try, but repeat customers can't get enough and will start ordering more donuts when they visit!  Powder Point also celebrates different holidays year-round, so get ready to unlock new festive ingredients as you play through the holidays!

Toca Lab: Plants,"Just like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:

● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?

● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?

● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!

● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!

● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!

Have fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!

FEATURES
- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!
- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!
- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.
- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.

Papa's Burgeria To Go!,"Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for Android phones.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  

You're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!

Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!

**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**

Papa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won’t get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

GRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!

BUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!


**GAME FEATURES**

- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe
- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens
- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving

The original Planescape: Torment was released in 1999 to widespread critical acclaim. It won RPG of the Year from multiple outlets for its unconventional story, characters, and amazing soundtrack.

Story:
""What can change the nature of a man?""

You are the Nameless One, a hulking figure covered in scars and tattoos collected over the course of countless lives—none of which you can remember, but are now coming back to haunt you. You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself.

In your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One’s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.

Papa's Pizzeria To Go!,"Top, bake, and serve pizzas in Papa's Pizzeria To Go!  This all-new version of the classic restaurant sim features updated gameplay and brand-new controls reimagined for smaller screens.

You'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **

Papa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

TOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.

BAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!

CUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, tables, decorations, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!

UPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play the game, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!

The Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action shooter,"🏆 <b>Over 500 thousand downloads on devices.</b>
⭐️ <b>A large post-apocalyptic world with many different quests!!!</b>
⭐️ <b>Perfect crafting system!!!  Assemble your power armor!!!</b> 
⭐️ <b>Awesome graphics at maximum settings!</b>

An action game with RPG elements in a cruel post-apocalyptic world, a world with radiation, hunger and disease. Only a few people managed to survive in that deadly attack that hit the planet from the space, but after a short time a new catastrophe started to threaten the survivors. And the main character, the Chosen of the North-216 Community, will have to deal with it. 

World of the post-apocalypse. First person shooter for survival.

The Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action — is a first-person shooter with RPG elements with its own history, hundreds of tasks, a huge arsenal of weapons and armor, trade, fighting factions, mutants, bandits and prowlers. Explore the world with a huge number of locations, buy the best weapons from the merchants and improve them. You will need only the best equipment! After all, your main goal is to save your Community from hunger. And let the struggle for survival begin!!!

Brief background.

In the year 2050, the sun unleashed a catastrophic surge of energy into space, a wave of power that would plunge our civilization into chaos for centuries. Though predicted for years by the scientific community, their warnings were ignored by the world leaders that instead squabbled over petty territorial concerns.

When the wave of energy struck the earth, a storm of radioactive particles blanketed the atmosphere in a deadly, carcinogenic fog. The fog killed indiscriminately… the young, old, rich and poor all fell in equal measure. Only those that had heeded the warnings and taken shelter in abandoned bunkers were spared. 

When their supplies eventually ran out and these communities were forced to emerge from their shelters, they saw a new world of desolation and chaos. A world in which the laws of civilization had been replaced by the law of the gun. The few areas that still had clean water and arable land were held by ruthless warlords and their armies.

It was in this world that a warrior known only as Raven would emerge. A warrior that would save his people by bending the wasteland to his will. A warrior that would one day become a legend.

It's a challenge! The world of the apocalypse or you?

Dear players! This game is very difficult! If you want to have a rest playing The Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action RPG, you'd better find another game for pleasant pastime. Cause in this game it's hell! Since the beginning of the project just few players could survive in rough conditions of Wasteland! But if you still decide to try, don't complain in the comments that you die of radiation, poisoning, thirst and hunger! And don't say that nobody warned you! Just the most attentive players won't have any problems with surviving in the world of The Sun: Origin! Good luck!","🏆 <b>Over 500 thousand downloads on devices.</b><br>⭐️ <b>A large post-apocalyptic world with many different quests!!!</b><br>⭐️ <b>Perfect crafting system!!!

• Story
The story begins in a forest near the village of Riders. Three young friends—the hero, Lilia, and Cheval—stumble upon a shining egg.

The trio perform a playful imitation of the Rite of Kinship, only to be shocked when it actually succeeds!

The egg hatches, revealing a baby Rathalos, a flying wyvern also known as ""the King of the Skies."" The trio affectionately name him ""Ratha,"" and take him back to the village.

Days later, without warning, the village is beset upon by a monster infected by ""the Black Blight."" They manage to drive it away, but not before it devastates the town—and leaves indelible scars in the hearts of Cheval and Lilia.

A year passes...

The hero receives a Kinship Stone from the Village Chief and officially becomes a Rider. Cheval and Lilia both leave the village, each on their own path. The hero, though separated now from childhood friends, partners up with the cheerful Navirou, and embarks upon a new adventure into the world of hunters.

A story of friendship and triumph await you—ride on into the world of Monster Hunter Stories!

2112TD: Tower Defense Survival,"Get ready for the ULTIMATE tower defense onslaught. Build, deploy, research and upgrade your defenses in this epic sci-fi adventure. 

Set 100 years in the future, battle inter-dimensional flesh spawn across the solar system and defend Earth's colonies from complete annihilation. 

The pace is steady, but the stakes are high as the relentless hordes amass in an effort to overrun your mobile command center. 

Unlike traditional TD games, you will be relying heavily on micro-managing dynamic action-based abilities. As you progress deeper into the campaign airstrikes, charged attacks, fortification walls and the tactical drone will become increasingly vital and deploying them strategically will be paramount. 

Mistakes won’t go unpunished so stay frosty, learn from your blunders and endure to fight another day. Without pain there can be no gain!

<b>FEATURES</b>

BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED ENVIRONMENTS AND GRAPHICS

2112TD’s artistic style is founded on the nostalgia of the RTS golden era, paying homage to games like Command and Conquer and StarCraft.

A CAMPAIGN TO TEST YOUR SKILLS

The battlefield is an unforgiving landscape and every second counts. Beginners will find forgiveness on normal mode while veterans will be drawn to the challenge of hard. When you’re ready it’s time to put your skills to the test in nightmare and survival. How long can you hold back the hordes?

BURN, BLAST AND OBLITERATE

Deploy the machine gun, flame thrower, artillery and plasma turrets to destroy your foes. Upgrade your towers to their experimental stages packing serious firepower and charged attacks.

DEATH FROM ABOVE

When the situation gets too hairy you’ll be relying on air support. The airstrike and tactical drone deliver the big BOOM as well as defensive abilities. 

RESEARCH TO VICTORY

Earth’s egg heads are working tirelessly to gain the upper hand against the new enemy. Unlock new abilities and weapons as you progress.

DISCOVER AND DOMINATE 

They call it the soldier’s dictionary. The tactical database gathers data on the battlefield about your arsenal and enemies alike. Be sure to check it often as it will be critical to your triumph against the hordes.

ACHIEVEMENTS & COMBAT STATISTICS

Commanders that excel on the battlefield will unlock achievements as a reward for their contributions in the struggle against the invaders. 

What are you waiting for commander? The flesh spawn must be eradicated!

<b>IN THE MEDIA</b>

""This is solid, old-school tower defense design where each and every map will cause you to sit back and think about what the best strategy might be.""

""2112TD takes the classic, Westwood RTS art-style and matches it up with TD, and it turns out that it fits really, really well.""

Star Traders: Frontiers,"You are the captain of a starship venturing through a massive open universe. Customize your crew and take command at the helm of your very own ship as you explore a galaxy torn apart by internal strife, alien threats, and political intrigue.

Command your ship and crew as a space pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more in Star Traders: Frontiers – an epic space RPG from Trese Brothers Games. Venture forth into a massive open universe, rich with adventure and the lore of the Star Traders. Choose your path by assembling and commanding your custom crew and spaceship in a constantly evolving galaxy torn by internal strife, political intrigue, and alien threats. Will you fly as a pirate terrorizing shipping lanes, join the solar wars as a military captain, or track targets across the stars as a fearsome bounty hunter?

 - Explore a rich, open universe: Discover endless procedurally-generated galactic maps, meet unique characters, and take on enemies to conquer the galaxy! 
 - Become an intergalactic captain: Take on the role of a spy, smuggler, explorer, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more (26 jobs total)!
 - Customize your own spaceship: Choose from more than 350 upgrades and 45 ship hulls to build your very own vessel to venture across the vast reaches of space. 
 - Assemble and tailor a loyal crew: Assign talents and equip specialized gear for every spaceship crew member.
 - Experience an ever-changing narrative: Decide to make friends or foes with other factions and influence political, economic, and personal vendettas.
 - Mold the crew by your choices: As you make decisions and set the tone for your ship, your crew will grow and change to match. Destroy enemy ships with all hands on deck and your crew will become more bloodthirsty and savage. Explore distant worlds and loot dangerous wastelands and your crew will become intrepid and clever ... or scarred and half-mad.
 - Varied Difficulty Options! play with save slots to try out different builds or storylines or turn on character permadeath and enjoy classic roguelike experience
 - Achievement Unlocks: accomplish story and challenge goals to unlock additional optional (but not better) content like new starting ships and new starting contacts

First there was the Exodus – when survivors of a great war left the ruins of the Galactic Core behind in search of a new home in the stars. Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun. Three centuries later, technology has brought them back together again. Discovery of the hyperwarp has bridged what was once an unimaginable distance between far-flung colonies, long-lost families, and political factions. 

With that reunification has come great economic prosperity. The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants – but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked. Amidst the political infighting, a ruthless revolution is rising – and the fervent explorers of the hyperwarp have awoken something that was better left asleep.

Our very first game, Star Traders RPG, took hundreds of thousands of gamers on an interstellar adventure. Star Traders’ success and overwhelmingly positive reception helped to launch Trese Brothers Games. It was the adventures of our community’s star-crossed captains that put us on a trajectory to share more of our worlds, ideas, and dreams.

We set out to capture the loneliness, bravery, and camaraderie of people living together in a spaceship sailing across the stars. It is with great pride that after releasing four other games in the Star Traders universe, we’ve created a sequel to the original Star Traders RPG.

Package Inc.,"Package Inc. is an inspiring delivery simulator, created by the same developers of Traffix and Railways.
The entire game is available without ads and features lovely milestones that can appeal to those who care most about style. Who wouldn’t like to have the Eiffel Tower in their city?

Package Inc. is a beautiful game about designing a delivery system for a growing city. Build a connection between different hubs and feed multiple destinations, like factories, police stations, cafes, libraries, boutiques, saloons, hotels, pizzerias, pet shops or schools. 

As new hubs are active and there is an increase on demand, you can redesign buildings’ position to keep your delivery process as smooth and efficient as possible. Speed and storage capacity are also essential to keep the delivery network running without inconveniences. How long can you keep the orders moving?

Features:
• Gracefully minimalist and beautiful visual design;
• Learn management stuff in a never-ending fun way;
• Original soundtrack and immersive experience (headphones are a must!);
• Multiple goals to achieve in real-world cities;
• Several upgrades (some hidden) to improve your network;
• Variety of moods: from extremely relaxing to super thrilling;
• Expand from a small town to a big city.

Package Inc. has an evocative visual design and shares the same minimalist features of Infinity Games previous titles. The game starts in a very relaxing pace but rapidly turns into a thrilling experience. Every game is unique, because the growth is random in each city. Your success is highly dependent on the quality and speed of your decisions. 

Goals: 
• Deliver as many packages as you can;
• Operate for many days;
• Add multiple destinations;
• Speed up delivery times; 
• Increase storage capacity.

Infinity Games aims to provide the best game experience within its titles. We love showcasing new minimalist puzzle games and making people think while relaxing.

Papa's Pancakeria To Go!,"-- ABOUT THE GAME --

While hunting for your lost pet, you suddenly get a call from Papa Louie with some good news:  Your pet was found at Papa's Pancakeria in Maple Mountain, and since your pet likes the restaurant so much, Papa Louie decided to let you run the Pancakeria while he's away!  

You'll be busy multitasking as your customers order fluffy pancakes, golden waffles, warm french toast, and delicious drinks through all seasons of the year.  Pour batter onto the griddle, add mixables to the batter, and keep checking back to flip the flapjacks halfway through.  Stack their plates high with pancakes, syrups, and toppings that change with each holiday.  Add a hot mug of coffee or a refreshing glass of juice to complete the breakfast, and serve the food to your hungry customers.  Customers can also place orders by phone, so hire a driver to deliver a hot breakfast right to their doors!

Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee,"Get it at a special 30% off launch price!

Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee is a Rogue-Like Dungeon-Defense game in which you and your team of heroes must protect the generator of your crashed ship while exploring an ever-expanding dungeon, all while facing waves of monsters and special events as you try to find your way out. The Apogee Edition of Dungeon Of The Endless includes the full game and five DLCs.

WHAT’S BEHIND THE DOOR?

A few hundred condemned criminals were being shipped to the Auriga system on board the prison hulk “Success”. While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.

In fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.

Luckily, every set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of Endless facility, all the way down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon…

Gather A Team
• Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)
• Equip them, deploy them, and earn powerful abilities
• Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guards

Build Your Defenses
• Use the Dust you gather to power the rooms
• Use scarce resources to help your team survive
• Build minor and major modules to hold off waves of monsters
• Decode Endless ruins to discover life-saving technologies

Open the Door
• Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anything
• Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layouts
• Carry your crystal through waves of monsters to the exit of each level
• Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about Auriga

The Apogee Edition includes the following add-ons
• DEEP FREEZE: New ship, New game mode and New character
• DEATH GAMBLE: New merchant
• RESCUE TEAM: Three new characters, New monsters, New major module
• ORGANIC MATTERS: New ship, New game mode, New character, New minor modules, New monsters

Papa's Cupcakeria To Go!,"Bake and decorate delicious cupcakes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Cupcakeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for smaller screens!

You'll need to multitask between four areas of the cupcake shop, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to take orders from your wacky customers in the lobby.  Switch to the Batter Station to prep the pans with liners and add just the right amount of batter.  Move to the Bake Station to put the cupcakes into the oven and wait for them to bake.  Jump to the Build Station to add frosting to the cupcakes, and decorate them with a variety of shakers, drizzles, and festive toppers.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the cupcake-crafting process.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Cupcakeria!  A set of well-crafted cupcakes will also earn you tips to spend on in the Shop, and Mini-Game Tickets to use in the daily Mini-Game!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added lots of new ingredients which can't be found in the original version of the game, including brand-new items for the new holidays in the game.  We've also added new holiday batters to the game, so each holiday's cupcakes will be even more unique!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

Choose a frosting type, then drag the cupcake left and right as the frosting pours down from above.  This new method gives you a great amount of control, letting you decorate your cupcakes like a pro!

ADDING TOPPINGS - The Topping Bin carousel from previous ""To Go"" games is back, making it easy to browse through your available toppings!  You'll swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the cupcake to start pouring toppings evenly across the cupcake.

Door Kickers,"The unforgiving, award-winning SWAT tactics and strategy game.

***RockPaperShotgun’s 'Bestest Best Tactics game' award***

***“Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***
84/100 – PC Gamer

***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***
Super Bunnyhop

***“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”***
Indie Statik


Door Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action/strategy with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.
Analyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points, and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.
Includes a new campaign, as well as full cross-platform saves compatibility and an all-new interface designed specifically for touch based platforms.

It may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.
Quick Points:
§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator
§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.
§ Top Down perspective for optimal strategic analysis
§ Real Time With Free Pause
§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces
§ Realistic but action packed
§ Non-linear levels, freeform strategy

But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!

Each year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.","** Play Store Most Innovative Game of 2016 **<br><br>Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom.

Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!,"<b>Join Crash Bandicoot and his sister Coco on a mission to save the multiverse!</b>

Think fast to keep Crash and Coco running, jumping, spinning and smashing in lanes loaded with obstacles. Speed through mysterious lands, defeating the henchmen of Doctor Neo Cortex.

Swipe to explore wild and exotic locations. Customize Crash and Coco with N.Sane Skins, build an arsenal of stupendous weapons, and hone those running skills for rewards.

Get ready for the run of a lifetime!

<b> Legendary locations and infamous bosses </b>
A variety of running challenges await Bandicoot fans, both new and back for more!

The Wumpa Archipelago is vast, featuring classics such as Turtle Woods, Temple Ruins and The Great Gate to delight all Crash fans. Every adventure is a thrill ride, risking dangerous Sewer or Later or a dash through the perilous Snow Go Mountain.

Dr Neo Cortex has pulled from the multiverse Crash and Coco's most dangerous enemies: Nina Cortex, Dingodile, Dr N-Gin, Fake Crash & Coco plus many more old and new bosses are stealing Power Gems. It's up to Crash and Coco to stop them!

<b>Team up for greater rewards</b>
Get ready to join the best Bandicoot in the asynchronous multiplayer runs!

Teams are about playing with friends and pulling together, with bragging rights for being the best and seeing your name on the leaderboards. Who went farthest, or lasted longest? By challenging others, your Team could claim huge Trophies.

<b>Adventure in bold Bandicoot style</b>
There is more than meets the eye with incredible skins available to unlock.

The classic Crash Bandicoot and Coco are yours from the start, plus Punk skins to make a statement. As you explore the multiverse, you'll unlock skins that give extra Trophies, bonuses, modifiers and even an Aku Aku Mask!

<b>Unlock new lands to explore</b>
Choose where to take Crash or Coco running for prizes or just for fun.

Rewards offered, or enemies faced, influence choices of Skins and weapons to take running with you. Islands pose varied challenges with multiple routes and lanes weaving to-and-fro, above and below. The resources to collect depend on the path you take, so choose wisely.

<b>Perfect that aim, boost your game</b>
When it comes to boss battles, Crash and Coco make weapons to take ’em down!

Serums to sloosh Frosty Ant Drone out of his lane. Bombs that rattle Nitro Crab in his shell. It takes a Ray Gun AND Bazooka to humiliate Nitro Neo Cortex.

<b>Build and upgrade your bandicoot base</b>
Help Coco to develop her Wumpa Island HQ.

Coco or Crash go on-the-run to comb Wumpa Island for resources. Parts are used to build high-tech labs where weapons get made, such as Nitro Bombs and Frosty Ray Guns.

In a world called Inamorta, you're surrounded by discriminate nations devoted to their individual nations technology and struggle for dominance. Each nation has developed its own unique way to defend and attack. Proud of their unique craft they have become obsessed to the point of worship, turning weapons to religion. Each believes that their way of life is the only way, and are dedicated to teaching their policies to all other nations through what their leaders claim as divine intervention, or as you will know it... war.

Suspects: Mystery Mansion,"You have been invited to solve a murder mystery at the mansion!

After discussing, the game will ask you to vote. Vote with your gut to evict the suspect from the mansion. But be careful: if you suspect another innocent guest and vote them out of the mansion, you will be helping the killers win the game!

You can either choose to play the game with your closest friends or with other players with a similar skill level, that the game will determine for you.
